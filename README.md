## About
`Junior Devs`

Junior Devs, is a twitter bot that was built to make job hunting for junior software less complicated.

This bot will go through the recent tweets on twitter and will automatically retweet them, so its followers can have less filtered tweets to look through rather than searching for selected keywords throughout their day.  

This app was created utilizing NodeJs , Twitter dev tools and is currently hosted on Heroku
